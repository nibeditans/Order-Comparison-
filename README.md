# Order-Comparison-
This Python module defines an Order class that facilitates the comparison between two orders based on their prices. It uses Python's special (or "dunder") method __gt__ to override the greater-than operator (>), making it possible to easily compare two instances of the class in terms of their price attribute. This module can be a handy addition to applications dealing with e-commerce, inventory management, or anywhere order comparisons are necessary.

## Features
* **Item and Price Storage:** Each order instance stores an item and its corresponding price.
* **Order Comparison:** Allows for intuitive comparison between two orders to determine which has a higher price.

## Requirements
Python 3.12.1 (Version can vary)

## Installation
No installation is required beyond having Python installed on your system.

## Usage
To use the Order class in your project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Download the order_comparison.py script from this repository (assuming the script is named as such).
3. Import the Order class from the script into your project as needed.

## Example

    from order_comparison import Order
    
    order1 = Order("Chips", 20)
    order2 = Order("Biscuit", 15)
    
    if order1 > order2:
        print(f"{order1.item} is more expensive than {order2.item}.")
    else:
        print(f"{order2.item} is more expensive than {order1.item}.")

## This should output:

    Chips is more expensive than Biscuit.

## Customization
The Order class can be extended or modified to include additional attributes such as quantity, discounts, or taxes. The comparison logic can also be adjusted or expanded (e.g., implementing __lt__ for less-than comparisons) based on your application's specific needs.
